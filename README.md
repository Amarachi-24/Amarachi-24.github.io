# About Me

I am Nneoma Onwe, a passionate learner with a background in programming languages such as C, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS. Networking is a new frontier for me, and I'm excited to delve into its complexities and discover its applications. Join me on this journey of exploration and growth in the world of computer networking!

# Languages

C: I have a solid understanding of C, which will be useful for networking programming and understanding protocols.
Python:  I have a solid understanding of Python, which will be useful for low-level networking programming for scripting and automation tasks, and it's widely used in networking for its simplicity and versatility.
SQL: While not directly related to networking, my proficiency in SQL allows me to work with databases, which often play a crucial role in networked applications.

# Goals
Gain a comprehensive understanding of networking fundamentals, including OSI model, TCP/IP stack, routing, and switching.
Learn various networking protocols such as DNS, DHCP, IP and TCP etc., and their implementations.
Develop practical skills in network programming using C and Python.
Develop proficiency in implementing networking solutions using my existing programming skills in C, Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
Build projects that demonstrate networking concepts and solutions to real-world problems.
Contribute to open-source networking projects and engage with the networking community on platforms like GitHub.

# Folders Structure 
projects/: Includes practical projects demonstrating networking principles, implemented in C , Python,SQL, Html and Css.

# Resources
Here are some resources I'm using for my networking study:

Python for Network Engineers - A free online course covering Python programming for networking tasks.
Wireshark - A network protocol analyzer that I'll use to inspect and analyze network traffic.
